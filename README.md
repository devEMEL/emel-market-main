### üîÑ How It Works

##### 1. Setup & Preparation
- Mint NFTs: Users without NFTs can mint new ones
- Convert to cWETH: Convert ETH to Confidential WETH for private bidding
- View Collection: Browse your NFTs on the profile page

##### 2. Creating Auctions
- Select an NFT from your collection
- Set auction start and end times
- The NFT is locked in the marketplace contract
- Auction becomes visible to all users

##### 3. Bidding Process
- Users submit encrypted bid amounts using their cWETH balance
- All bids are confidential - no one can see the amounts
- Users can increase their bids multiple times
- The system tracks the highest bid without revealing amounts

##### 4. Auction Resolution
1. Auction ends based on the predetermined time
2. Auction owner calls decryptWinningAddress() to initiate winner selection
3. The system decrypts the winning address through a callback
4. Owner calls resolveAndRefundLosers() to finalize the auction:
   - Losing bidders receive automatic refunds
   - Winner's payment is transferred to auction owner
   - NFT is transferred to the winning bidder
##### 5. Privacy & Security
- Bid amounts remain encrypted throughout the process
- Only the final winner is revealed
- All losing bids are refunded automatically
- The system prevents reentrancy attacks and ensures secure operations
